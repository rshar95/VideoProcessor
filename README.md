# Distributed Real-Time Video Processing

This project is a system that processes and analyzes video streams from YouTube in real-time by distributing the workload across multiple machines. The system is designed to handle a high throughput of video data and is optimized for low latency by using advanced parallel processing techniques and network protocols.

### Requirements

- C++ compiler (g++ or clang++)
- MPI library (if you're using distributed processing module)
- MySQL Connector (if you're using database module)
- AngularJS (if you're using front-end module)
- Make (to build the project)
